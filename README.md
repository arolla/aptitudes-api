# WTF?

I'm a skills matrix, intended to manage people skills: what they can do, what they wanna do.

# TODO

## Aptitudes 101

- CRUD employees.
- On ppl, tell how strong they are on skills (to CRUD), and what skills they wanna work on.
- Search ppl from skills.
- Warning: at one point, we will want to be able to browse history.

## And then?

In any order:

- Attach resume and presentation.
- Browse people history.
- Log in.
- Manage skills: deduplicate...
